# Simple Linked List (Reference)
This is for people who want to implement a simple linked list in Java,
but want to start counting at 1. (Because they are absolutely insane).

This uses J-Unit, so for easy setup to get Tests folder working, try using IntelliJ. You can get a copy for free using student email.

This is meant to be a reference for those in Computer Science that want learn how Linked Lists work.

This linked list is used in a Stack and a Queue implementation.
